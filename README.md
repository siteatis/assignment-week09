# intermediate push, very bare-bones, not quite MVP yet and a few things not working properly, but need to make sure it deploys OK in good time

So far:

# Notes

1. CLERK

- Sign up (username) & log in securely and edit profile, log out

2. NOTFOUND

- Error/not found page if visit nonexistent page

3. MOTION

- modern UI components, eg Radix UI primitive or similar, for nicer interface
- See notepad & https://techeducators.moodlecloud.com/mod/assign/view.php?id=6242

A) USER PROFILE PAGE

- Check user logged in and allow to edit their profile (username fixed, change password & bio, S: show user stats)
- Route such as user/[userId]
- Create new post
- S: prompt on login if bio left blank

B) HOME PAGE

- Logged in state (always shows in header) and option to log out or sign up

C) NOTFOUND PAGE

- With suitable settings and link back to homepage (S: or user profile if logged in)
- TODO: See if I need a separate one for the leaf pages or if it falls upwards
- See Notepad & Moodle: https://techeducators.moodlecloud.com/mod/assign/view.php?id=6240

D) PROFILE PAGE

- Based on which user is logged in, else no access.
- Shows bio and the user's posts.
- S: User can edit/delete own post (edit on dynamic route (‚Äú/posts/[id]/edit‚Äù) or by creating a modal).

E) S: GLOBAL TIMELINE

- S: show all posts so anyone can view and click thru to that user's profile
- SS: let posts be public/users

F) PLUMBING

- Customise clerk with imported route matcher?

X) STYLES

- use 1+ radix ui cmpt or similar

# Assets (text)

What is there to say about Alice? Well, no description would be complete without mentioning that lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Mauris sagittis nulla magna, dignissim laoreet ante elementum in. Nam malesuada arcu quis odio viverra porttitor. Suspendisse eu pretium diam. Duis aliquam nisl a quam aliquam congue. Etiam consectetur nibh nec ex sodales feugiat. Nullam malesuada enim quis est tincidunt dictum. Ut. And that's really as much as we can tell you about Alice without, just, like, totally blowing your mind.

Barry's biography. Barry has a biography full of biographical information. Barry's biography full of biographical information, is full of biographical information from his biography. His biography, full of biographical information, also is full of biographical information from his biography.

Barry likes posting so much that he's decided to do it again, and this time directly, instead of through the SQL editor on Supabase.

Barry is pleased that his post worked first time with no bugs and immediately appeared on the page. He's going to go and snoop at other users' profiles now.
